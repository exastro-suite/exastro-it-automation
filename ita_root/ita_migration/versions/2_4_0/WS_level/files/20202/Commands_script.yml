# This Playbook file transfers and executes script files specified by the "ITA_DFLT_Script_Name".
# Doing so adds the following two arguments to the script file, allowing them to be used within said script.
#  First argument: __workflowdir__
#  Second argument: __conductor_workflowdir__
# For example, if a file is output to "__workflowdir__" while the script is processing, the user will be able to retrieve it as result data after the Movement ends.
# Similarly, by outputting a file to __conductor_workflowdir__ as a process within the script, it is possible to convey information to subsequent Movemenet after the Movement ends.
# However, these functions are only enabled when running scripts on a nodes that has access to __workflowdir__ and __conductor_workflowdir__ (e.g. localhost).
# The task results are displayed at debug level 3 (-vvv).
